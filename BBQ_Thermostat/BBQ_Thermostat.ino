/* 
 *  BBQ Thermostat
 *  
 *  This design will read the temperature in a smoker and then adjust a fan connected to the air intake to control the temperature. 
 *  
 *  V1.0 - will measure the temperature and send the data via MQTT <- currently here
 *  V1.1 - will receive a target temp via MQTT
 *  V2.0 - will control the fan
 *  
 *  The current circuit:
 *  
 *  - Arduino MKR WiFi 1010
 *  - Arduino MKR THERM Shield attached
 *  - A K Type thermocouple temperature sensor connected to the shield
 *  
 *  Code licensed under GPL V3.0
